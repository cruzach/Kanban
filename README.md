# KanbanMobileApp

This is a final project for CS50M (Mobile App dev with React Native). 

It is a Kanban app (glorified todo list) where you can add/delete tasks, and organize them into 'todo', 'doing', and 'done' pages.
I wanted to gain some additional experience working with something I had little experience with and that the course did NOT cover, so I decided to maintain the todos which make up the app's general state in a webSQL-like API, through Expo (https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/sdk/sqlite).

I will most likely reimplement this app using some more tools now that I have (almost) finished the course, getting rid of the database and instead just using redux persist to maintain the state, even when the app is closed.

Forgive the unorganized files, this is a work a progress but I will get to organizing and 'foldering' soon!
